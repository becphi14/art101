        <h2>Challenge:</h2>
        <p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with jQuey and AJAX. We
        wanted to access an API, and have it output results onto our webpage.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="problems">
        <h2>Problems:</h2>
        <p>Our biggest problem for this lab was not understanding what an endpoint was.
        We found an API that we liked, but then did not know how to actually find the
        information we needed to link. After figuring it out, the lab went smoothly
        from there.</p>
