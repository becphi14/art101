	<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving<h1>
	<h2> Challenge </h2>
	<p> The idea of this lab was to practice pseudocoding,
		and to break tasks down into a list of instructions that
		we could then eventually code. <p>

	<h2> Problems </h2>
 	<p> We had a lot of trouble coming up with ways to phrase our psuedocode
		 comments for java script that were action-based and suscinct. We
		 weren't sure of which phrases to use as we had little prior experience
		 with coding. </p>

	<h2> Results </h2>
		<div id="task1">
			<h3> Task 1 - Pseudocode an everyday task </h3>
			<p> First we created a list of instructions for an everyday task:
				How to Make Pasta!
				<ol>
					<li>Boil Water in a pot </li>
					<li>Add Salt to water</li>
					<li>Place noodles into boiling water</li>
					<li>Wait until noodles are soft</li>
					<li>Drain noodles in colander</li>
					<li>Heat tomato sauce in separate pot</li>
					<li>Mix finished noodles in with the sauce</li>
					<li>Season to taste with salt and pepper</li>
					<li>Eat!</li>
				</ol>
		</div>

	<div id="task2">
		<h3>Task 2 - Pseudocode a Computer Task</h3>
		<p>Next, we created a list of instructions for a computer game: Connect4<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Create a 6x7 grid board before each game</li>
				<li>Assign each player a color</li>
					<ul>
						<li>One player assigned blue, one player assigned yellow</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Receive user’s move</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Detect the row the user selects</li>
						<li>Land their token in the next available bottom space in that row</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Confirm user’s move</li>
				<li>Assess possible counter-moves</li>
				<li>Select best counter-move</li>
				<li>Test for Win! Condition</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Check for 4-in-a-row of one color (diagonally, horizontally, vertically)</li>
					</ul>
			</ol>
	</div>

	<div id="task3">
		<h3>	Task 3: Turn Pseudocode into Comments </h3>
		<p>Then, we turned our list of instructions into pseudocode in a JavaScript file:</p>
		<img src=img/pseudocode-js.jpg>
		<p>And here's what it looks like when put straight into this HTML file:</p>
			<pre>
					//Print a 6x7 grid board before each turn
					  //Loop through each row
					    //Loop through each space
					      //Print a blue token, a yellow token, or space
					    //Print a vertical line between
					    //Print a horizontal line between
					//Assign each player a color
					  //Choose one player to be blue
					    //Choose the remaining player to be yellow
					//Receive user’s move
					  //Detect the row the user selects
					    //Land their token in the next available bottom space in that row
					//Confirm user’s move
					//Assess possible counter-moves
					  //Analyse oponent's positions on the board
					    //Test each possible move and outcome
					//Select best counter-move
					//Test for Win! Condition
					  //Check for 4-in-a-row of one color (diagonally, horizontally, vertically)
			</pre>
