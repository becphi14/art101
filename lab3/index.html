	<h1>Lab 3 - File Stuctures & File Transfer	</h1>
	<p>Thie idea of this lab was to futher create a local file structure
		on my computer and add index.html files. This is meant to practice
		organization, as well as demonstrate where my files actually are
		and how to retrieve them. </p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p> It was fairly easy to locate the file structures on my computer,
		given that we were gifted a pre-organized template. I had a little
		bit of trouble simply keeping things straight (what goes in what
		folder, etc.), once i explored the file structure a bit, it became
		easier.
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p> Well, here it is. And here is the file structure:</p>

		<figcaption>My homepage in a browser</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>Then, I created this page that you are viewing right now:</p>
