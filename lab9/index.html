        <h2>Challenges:</h2>
          <p>Working with JS within the console vs. Atom is a lot more confusing
            because you cannot see the errors as you go. You have to go back and
             edit after you save and test locally. </p>
        <h2>Problems:</h2>
          <p>We got the error message of "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property
            'appendChild'of null at line _ . There was also a bit of difficulty
            finding the right ID within the HTML and CSS for the project. We
            created a new ID 'dream' to target the paragraph tag. We forgot to
            put the tag name before the style.color which caused another error
            message. We also forgot to put in "defer" to the JS link in the index,
            but once we added back in and fixed our other issues, everything ran smoothly!"</p>
        <h2>Results:</h2>
          <p>See our results below! We added two new elements and styled them in JavaScript.</p>
