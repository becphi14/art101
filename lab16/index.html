        <h2>Challenge:</h2>
        <p>This lab's challenge was to access an API, locate the endpoint, and have
        it output onto a webpage. This involves experimenting with JSON, and
        understanding how to manipulate and use it.</p>

      <div id="problems">
        <h2>Problems:</h2>
        <p>We had quite a few problems with this lab, most of which led back to our variable
        not being defined correctly. Once we figured out how to define the empty variable, we could
        modify it the way we wanted to within the different functions. Once explained, this
        lab was not too hard beyond just figuring how to structure the functions and variables.</p>
