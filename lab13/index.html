      <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this lab is to practice and experiment with loops, and
        have the output show up on a webpage. We want to use our knowledge of both loops
        and conditionals to print the words "Fizz", "Buzz", "Boom", and any combination
        of the three in place of certain numbers. </p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>We definitely had a lot of problems with this lab, but were finally able to get
          it after hours of trying! Once we figured out that we needed to have all of our
         rules be "if" conditionals, and not "else if", the words and numbers printed
         on the page. We struggled with how to get the output to print onto the page,
         and not just in the console, but with a little help we figured it out.
