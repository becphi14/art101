      <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>The idea of this lab was to experiment with JavaScript events,
        and to create an input box with a submit button. The user's input
        will then get shuffled and turned into a new username for them.</p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>We had several problems with this lab. First, in our Lab 7 function
        that we copied over, we had to remove the pop-up window. We were not
        sure of what to define userName as in the pop-up window's place, and in
        putting the wrong thing, our function showed more errors in the console â€“
        specifically that "userName.split" was not a function. Additionally, we
        struggled with finding a way to run the input value through the nameSorter
        function and then saving the results to appear as the output with the
        addEventListener function. After a lot of time spent and trial and error,
        along with some clarification from class, we finally got it to work.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Our results are below. Prepare for new username!</p>
        <p>Input Your Name:</p>
          <input type="text" id="user-name"></input>
          <button id="my-button">Submit</button>

          <p>Your new username:</p>
          <br><div id="output"></div></br>
